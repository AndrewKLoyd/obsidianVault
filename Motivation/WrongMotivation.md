DONT motivate youself via finish result like: I'll get payed more; I'll have sexy body etc... . The hard fork for some result makes that work much more challenging => you won't like the hard work or any type of work in the future.
Because the reward comes at the end of activity, we don't associate activity with dophamine but reward only
