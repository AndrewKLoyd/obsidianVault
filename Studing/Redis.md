Redis is a [[DataBase]], but not like [[SQL]]
the main differences
* Doesn't use table, but all stored as a <key, value> pairs.
* think about it as a about large JSON object
* Runs in RAM and it's relly fast (Could lose everything if system crash)
* Use ti every time, when need to acesses data quick (quicker than standart DataBase like [[SQL]])
* Hemoroic to install it on windows))) (Have a great [[Anal sex]])
